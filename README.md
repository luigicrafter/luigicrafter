## Introduction
Hello there.

I am Lois and currently 17 years old.

This is my personal and school account.

My school programming group: [LoMaTiInformatik](https://github.com/LoMaTiInformatik/)

## Projects

### Currently working on

### Finished
None yet unfortunately :/

### Future / Ideas
- "Lesson buddy" (A robot that sits on your shoulder and answers voice commands, especially about my lesson plan. e.g. "Buddy, where do I need to go?", "Buddy, what's my next lesson?")
